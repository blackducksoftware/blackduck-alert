## Requirements

- A Docker host with at least 2GB of allocatable memory.
- Administrative access to the docker host machine. 
- Before installing or upgrading Alert the desired persistent storage volumes must be created for Alert and needs to be either:
    - Node locked.     
    - Backed by an NFS volume or a similar mechanism.

## Installing Alert
Deployment files for Docker Swarm are located in the *docker-swarm* directory of the zip file.
```
blackduck-alert-<VERSION>-deployment.zip file.
```
- Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
- For installing with Black Duck the files are located in the *hub* sub-directory.
- For installing Alert standalone the files are located in the *standalone* sub-directory.

### Standalone Installation
This section will walk through the instructions to install Alert in a standalone fashion.

#### Overview

1. Create ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD secret.
2. Create ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT secret.
3. Manage certificates.
4. Modify environment variables.
5. Deploy the stack.
 
#### Details 
This section will walk through each step of the installation procedure.

##### 1. Create ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD secret.
  
- Create a docker secret containing the encryption password for Alert.

    ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD <FILE_CONTAINING_PASSWORD>```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    - Replace <FILE_CONTAINING_PASSWORD> with the path to the file containing the password text.
    
- Make sure the alert service is uncommented from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
- Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file alert service section.
    ```
        alert:
            secrets:
                - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
    ```
    
- Uncomment the following from the secrets section of the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.

    ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT <FILE_CONTAINING_SALT>```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    - Replace <FILE_CONTAINING_SALT> with the path to the file containing the salt text.
    
    Note: If you created the secret ALERT_ENCRYPTION_SALT in a version of Alert prior to 5.x, please use the same salt value for the ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT secret.
    
- Make sure the alert service is uncommented from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
- Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file alert service section.
    ```
        alert:
            secrets:

                - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
    ```
- Uncomment the following from the secrets section of the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
    ```
        secrets:
            ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD:
              external: true
              name: "<STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD"
            
    ```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.

##### 2. Create ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT secret.

- Create a docker secret containing the encryption salt for Alert.
        
    ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT <FILE_CONTAINING_SALT>```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    - Replace <FILE_CONTAINING_SALT> with the path to the file containing the salt text.
    
    Note: If you created the secret ALERT_ENCRYPTION_SALT in a version of Alert prior to 5.x, please use the same salt value for the ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT secret.
    
- Make sure the alert service is uncommented from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
- Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file to the alert service section.
    ```
        alert:
            secrets:
                - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
                - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT
    ```
- Uncomment the following from the secrets section of the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
    ```
        secrets:
            ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD:
              external: true
              name: "<STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD"
            ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT:
              external: true
              name: "<STACK_NAME>_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT"
            
    ```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.

##### 3. Manage certificates
This is an optional step. Confirm if custom certificates or a certificate store need to be used.
- Using custom certificate for Alert web server. See [Using Custom Certificates](#using-custom-certificates)
- Using custom trust store to trust certificates of external servers. See [Using Custom Certificate TrustStore](#using-custom-certificate-truststore)

#### 4. Modify environment variables.
Please see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- Set the required environment variable ALERT_HOSTNAME. See [Alert Hostname Variable](#alert-hostname-variable)
- Set the required environment variable PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST. See [Black Duck Web Server Host](#black-duck-web-server-host)
- Set any other optional environment variables as needed.

##### 5. Update the Black Duck installation to set the USE_ALERT environment variable for the NGinX container.
In the Black Duck deployment files set the following variable for the webserver container: 
```USE_ALERT=1``` 

##### 6. Install Black Duck.
- Follow the installation procedure for installing Black Duck. 

Note: The NGinX container will not start correctly when it is waiting for the alert service to be available.  
Deploy alert onto the stack and NGinX will eventually become healthy when the alert service is up and running. 

##### 7. Deploy the stack.
- Execute the command to add Alert to the stack: 
    ```
    docker stack deploy -c <PATH>/docker-swarm/hub/docker-compose.yml -c <PATH>/docker-swarm/docker-compose.local-overrides.yml <STACK_NAME>
    ```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    - Replace <PATH> with the directory path to the Alert installation files. 
    - Use the same stack name used to install Black Duck from step 6 i.e. blackduck.
    ```
    docker stack deploy -c <PATH>/docker-swarm/hub/docker-compose.yml -c <PATH>/docker-swarm/docker-compose.local-overrides.yml blackduck
    ```

## Upgrading Alert
Remove the stack and then re-deploy the stack.
The steps in the upgrade procedure are the same as the installation procedure after removing the stack.

### Verify Secrets 
1. Review the docker secrets.

    ```docker secret ls```

### Standalone Upgrade
1. Run ```docker stack rm <STACK_NAME>``` replacing <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment. 
2. Follow the [Standalone Installation](#standalone-installation)

### Upgrade with Black Duck
1. Run ```docker stack rm <STACK_NAME>``` replacing <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
2. Follow [Installation with Black Duck](#installation-with-black-duck)

## Certificates 
This section describes how to configure the optional certificates.  Please verify beforehand if custom certificates or a certificate truststore must be used.

### Using Custom Certificates 
- Custom certificates for the Alert Web server to present to clients.

    - Before custom certificates can be used for Alert the signed certificate and key must be available.

        - WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_CERT_FILE - The file containing the customer's signed certificate.
    
        ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_CERT_FILE <PATH_TO_CERT_FILE>```
        - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
        - Replace <PATH_TO_CERT_FILE> with the path to the certificate file.

        - WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_KEY_FILE - The file containing the customer's key used to create the certificate.

        ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_KEY_FILE <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>```
        - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
        - Replace <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> with the path to the certificate file.
        
    - Uncomment the following secrets from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file alert service section.
    ```
        alert:
            secrets:
                - WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_CERT_FILE
                - WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_KEY_FILE
    ```
    - Uncomment the following secrets from the secrets section of the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
    ```
        secrets:
            WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_CERT_FILE:
                external: true
                name: "<STACK_NAME>_WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_CERT_FILE"
            WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_KEY_FILE:
                external: true
                name: "<STACK_NAME>_WEBSERVER_CUSTOM_KEY_FILE"
    ```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    
### Using Custom Certificate TrustStore
- Custom java TrustStore file for the Alert server to communicate over SSL to external systems.

    Must have a valid JKS trust store file that can be used as the TrustStore for Alert.  
    If certificate errors arise, then this is the TrustStore where certificates will need to be imported to resolve those issues. 
    
    Only one of the following secrets needs to be created.  If both are created, then jssecacerts secret will take precedence and be used by Alert.

    - Create the secret.  Only create one of the following secrets.
        - jssecacerts - The java TrustStore file with any custom certificates imported.
            
            ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_jssecacerts <PATH_TO_TRUST_STORE_FILE>```
            - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
            - Replace <PATH_TO_TRUST_STORE_FILE> with the path to the TrustStore file to be used.
    
        or 
    
        - cacerts - The java TrustStore file with any custom certificates imported. 
            
            ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_cacerts <PATH_TO_TRUST_STORE_FILE>```
            - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
            - Replace <PATH_TO_TRUST_STORE_FILE> with the path to the TrustStore file to be used.
            
    - Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file from the secrets section near the bottom of the file.
    ```
        secrets:
            jssecacerts:
                external: true
                name: "<STACK_NAME>_jssecacerts"
    ```
    or 
    ```
        secrets:
            cacerts:
                external: true
                name: "<STACK_NAME>_cacerts"
    ```
    - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    - Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file from the services alert section
    ```
        secrets:
            - source: jssecacerts
              target: jssecacerts
              mode: 0664
    ```
    or
    ```
        secrets:
            - source: cacerts
              target: cacerts
              mode: 0664
    ```
    Note: The mode (file permissions) must be specified because the certificate file is copied to a location Alert uses internally. Read/Write permissions are required to copy the file and import certificates into the TrustStore.
    
    - Create a docker secret containing the password for the trust store.
        
        ```docker secret create <STACK_NAME>_ALERT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD <FILE_CONTAINING_PASSWORD>```
        - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
        - Replace <FILE_CONTAINING_PASSWORD> with the path to the file containing the password text.
    
    - Make sure the alert service is uncommented from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
    - Uncomment the following from the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file alert service section.
        ```
            alert:
                secrets:
                    - ALERT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD
        ```
    - Uncomment the following from the secrets section of the docker-compose.local-overrides.yml file.
        ```
            secrets:
                ALERT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD:
                  external: true
                  name: "<STACK_NAME>_ALERT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD"
                
        ```
        - Replace <STACK_NAME> with the name of the stack to be used in the deployment.
    
    
### Insecure Trust of All Certificates
WARNING: This is not a recommended option. Using this option makes your deployment less secure. Use at your own risk.
Certificates SHOULD be correctly generated for the Alert server and a valid TrustStore SHOULD be provided to trust third party systems.

This option allows the bypass of all certificate verification in the event that external certificates can not be imported into the Alert TrustStore, or certificate errors continue after importing the external certificates into the Alert TrustStore.

To allow Alert to trust all certificates add the environment variable: 
```
ALERT_TRUST_CERT=true
```
Please see the section [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) to learn how to set the environment variables.

## Environment Variables
Alert supports configuration of the application's components via environment variables.
Edit the ```docker-compose.local-overrides.yml``` file to include the environment variables.

### Editing the Overrides File
- Verify that ```alert:``` is uncommented from the service section, otherwise uncomment the ```alert:``` of docker-compose.local-overrides.yml.
- Uncomment ```environment:``` from the alert service section of docker-compose.local-overrides.yml. 
- Environment variables have the format ```- <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VARIABLE_VALUE>``` 
- Environment variables are commented out in the ```docker-compose.local-overrides.yml``` file. 
- Uncomment the environment variables to be used from the ```environment: ``` section of the alert service.

Example:
```
alert:
    environment:
        - ALERT_HOSTNAME=localhost
```

### Environment Variable Overrides
The environment variables will always take precedence and overwrite the values stored in the database if the following variable value is set to 'true'.

```ALERT_COMPONENT_SETTINGS_SETTINGS_STARTUP_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_OVERRIDE=true```

Please note the following with the override environment variable set. 
If any other environment variable is set with no value or an empty string, then the corresponding value (if any) in the database will be removed.

### Alert Hostname Variable
The ALERT_HOSTNAME environment variable must be specified in order for Alert to generate and use certificates correctly.
- Add the ALERT_HOSTNAME environment variable. (The value must be the hostname only.)

    - Editing overrides file:
    ```
    alert:
        environment:
            - ALERT_HOSTNAME=<NEW_HOST_NAME>
    ```
    - Replace <NEW_HOST_NAME> with the hostname of the machine where Alert is installed.
- Do not add the protocol a.k.a scheme to the value of the variable.
    - Good: ```ALERT_HOSTNAME=myhost.example.com```
    - Bad: ```ALERT_HOSTNAME=https://myhost.example.com```

### Alert Logging Level Variable
To change the logging level of Alert add the following environment variable to the deployment. 

- Editing overrides file: 
    ```
    alert:
        environment: 
           - ALERT_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
    ```

- Set the value to one of the following: 
    - DEBUG
    - ERROR
    - INFO
    - TRACE
    - WARN

### Black Duck Web Server Host
The PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST environment variable should be specified when you are installing Alert with Black Duck and the Black Duck instance. 
If a PKIX error occurs when configuring the Black Duck provider in Alert, then specifying this environment variable may solve the problem.
Alert will attempt to import the Black Duck server's certificate into the Trust Store Alert uses. 

- Add PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST environment variable. (The value must be the hostname only.)

    - Editing overrides file:
    ```
    alert:
        environment:
            - PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST=<BLACK_DUCK_HOST_NAME>
    ```
    - Replace <BLACK_DUCK_HOST_NAME> with the hostname of the machine where Black Duck is installed.
- Do not add the protocol a.k.a scheme to the value of the variable.
    - Good: ```PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST=blackduck.example.com```
    - Bad: ```PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST=https://blackduck.example.com```   
    
### Black Duck Web Server Port
The PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_PORT environment variable should be specified if Black Duck is running on another port other than the default https (443) port.

- Add PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_HOST environment variable. (The value must be the hostname only.)

    - Editing overrides file:
    ```
    alert:
        environment:
            - PUBLIC_HUB_WEBSERVER_PORT=<BLACK_DUCK_PORT>
    ```
    - Replace <BLACK_DUCK_PORT> with the hostname of the machine where Black Duck is installed. 

### Email Channel Environment Variables
A majority of the Email Channel environment variables that can be set are related to JavaMail configuration properties. The JavaMail properties can be found here: 

[JavaMail Properties](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html)

- The Email Channel environment variables have a prefix of ```ALERT_CHANNEL_EMAIL_```
- The remaining portion of the variable, after the prefix, map to the JavaMail properties if the '_' character is replaced with '.'

Examples:
- ALERT_CHANNEL_EMAIL_MAIL_SMTP_HOST maps to 'mail.smtp.host'
- ALERT_CHANNEL_EMAIL_MAIL_SMTP_PORT maps to 'mail.smtp.port'

### Environment Variable Classifications
There are certain classifications with the environment variables expressed by a specific naming convention:
```ALERT_<CLASSIFICATION>_<ITEM_NAME>_<CONFIGURATION_PROPERTY>```
- Provider:  The environment variables to configure these components start with ALERT_PROVIDER_
- Channel: The environment variables to configure these components start with ALERT_CHANNEL_
- Component: The environment variables to configure these components start with ALERT_COMPONENT_

Examples:
These are some examples of what can be set. the blackduck-alert.env file has a more comprehensive list.
- Provider: 
    - ALERT_PROVIDER_BLACKDUCK_BLACKDUCK_URL= The URL for the Black Duck server.
- Channel:
    - ALERT_CHANNEL_JIRA_CLOUD_JIRA_CLOUD_URL= The URL for the Jira Cloud server.
    - ALERT_CHANNEL_EMAIL_MAIL_SMTP_HOST= The SMTP host used to send email messages.
- Component: 
    - ALERT_COMPONENT_SETTINGS_SETTINGS_LDAP_ENABLED= Boolean to determine if LDAP authentication is used.

## Advanced Configuration
This section describes some advanced configuration settings for the Alert server.

### Changing Server Port
If Alert should not be running on its default port of 8443, then this section describes what must be changed in order to use a different port.

For this advanced setting, since there are more than just environment variables that need to be set, edit the ```docker-compose.local-overrides.yml``` file.

- Overrides File Changes
    - Define the new ports for the alert service.  Add 'ports' to the service description. 
    ```
        alert: 
            ports: ['<NEW_PORT>:<NEW_PORT>']
    ```
    - Define the ```ALERT_SERVER_PORT``` environment variable.
    ```
        alert: 
            environment:
                - ALERT_HOSTNAME=localhost
                - ALERT_SERVER_PORT=<NEW_PORT>
    ```
    - Define the healthcheck for the alert service. Add 'healthcheck' to the service description.
    ```
        alert:
            healthcheck:
                  test: [CMD, /usr/local/bin/docker-healthcheck.sh, 'https://localhost:<NEW_PORT>/alert/api/about',
                         /opt/blackduck/alert/security/root.crt, /opt/blackduck/alert/security/blackduck_system.crt,
                         /opt/blackduck/alert/security/blackduck_system.key]
                  interval: 30s
                  timeout: 60s
                  retries: 15
    ```
    - Replace <NEW_PORT> with the port to be used.
Example:
- Change the port to 9090 via the ```docker-compose.local-overrides.yml``` file for the blackduck stack.
```
    alert:
        ports: ['9090:9090']
        environment:
            - ALERT_HOSTNAME=localhost
            - ALERT_SERVER_PORT=9090
        secrets:
            - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
            - ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT
        healthcheck:
            test: [CMD, /usr/local/bin/docker-healthcheck.sh, 'https://localhost:9090/alert/api/about',
                 /opt/blackduck/alert/security/root.crt, /opt/blackduck/alert/security/blackduck_system.crt,
                /opt/blackduck/alert/security/blackduck_system.key]
            interval: 30s
            timeout: 60s
            retries: 15
    secrets:
        ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD:
            external: true
            name: "blackduck_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD"
        ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT:
            external: true
            name: "blackduck_ALERT_ENCRYPTION_GLOBAL_SALT"
```
  
Note: Work with your IT staff if necessary to verify the configured port is accessible through the network.

### Changing Memory Settings
If Alert should be using more memory than its default settings, then this section describes what must be changed in order to allocate more memory.

For this advanced setting, since there are more than just environment variables that need to be set, edit the ```docker-compose.local-overrides.yml``` file.

- Overrides File Changes.
    - Define the ```ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE``` environment variable:
    ```
        alert:
            environment:
                - ALERT_HOSTNAME=localhost
                - ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=<NEW_HEAP_SIZE>
    ```
    - Define the container memory limit. Add the deploy section to the alert service description.
    ```
        alert:
            deploy:
                resources:
                    limits: {memory: <NEW_HEAP_SIZE + 256M>}
                    reservations: {memory: <NEW_HEAP_SIZE + 256M>}: 
    ```
    - Replace <NEW_HEAP_SIZE> with the heap size to be used.
    Note: 
        The ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE and the container deploy.resources settings should not be exactly the same.  
        The container deploy.resources setting is the maximum memory allocated to the container.  
        Additional memory does not get allocated to it.  
        The maximum heap size in Java is the maximum size of the heap in the Java virtual machine (JVM), but the JVM also uses additional memory.  
        Therefore, the ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE environment variable must be less than the amount defined in the mem_limit which is set for the container. 
        Synopsys recommends setting the deploy.resources using the following formula: ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE + 256M.
        
            ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE = 4096M
            limits = ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE + 256M = 4096M + 256M = 4352M
            reservations = ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE + 256M = 4096M + 256M = 4352M
                
Example: 
- Change the memory limit from 2G to 4G.
```
    alert:
        environment:
            - ALERT_HOSTNAME=localhost
            - ALERT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=4096M
        deploy:
            resources:
                limits: {memory: 4352M}
                reservations: {memory: 4352M}
```

Note: Work with your IT staff if necessary to verify the configured memory is available on the host machine.
